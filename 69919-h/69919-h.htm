<p><i>The wars of the far future will be fought with giant spaceships,
but it will still take the infantryman to hold down the planets. And
some of the thoughts bred in the foxholes of Mars or Alpha Centauri
Duo or Rigel Tres will be fully as bitter as some of those dredged up
in the foxholes of Earth.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Ever inward from the jagged horizon the machines of death crept, edged,
scurried, rocketed, and tunneled towards him. It seemed as if all this
purple-sunned creation had conspired to isolate, to smash him. To the
west—for all planets share a west, if nothing else—the nuclear bombs
bloomed, meaningless giant fungi. Invisibly overhead the spaceships
roared, distant as gods, yet shaking the yellow sky. Even the soil was
treacherous, nauseated by artificial earthquakes—nobody's mother,
least of all an Earthman's.</p>

<p>"Why don't you cheer up?" the others had said to him. "It's a mad
planet." But he would not cheer up, for he knew what they said was
literally true. Soon they would fall back and the enemy would retake
the mangled thing they called an objective. Was it the sixth time? The
seventh? And did the soldiers on the other side have six legs, or
eight? The enemy were pretty haphazard as to what troops they used in
this sector.</p>

<p>Worse was the noise. Meaningless, mechanical screeches tore at his
skull, until thoughts rattled around in it like dry seeds in a dry pod.
He started to lift his hands to his ears, then checked the gesture,
convulsed with soundless laughter and tearless weeping, bitter memories
and searing hatred. Once there had been a galactic society—a galactic
empire—and he had played an unnoticed part on one of its nice quiet
planets ... but now? Galactic empire? Galactic horse-dung! Perhaps
he had always hated his fellow men as much as he did now. But in
the prewar days his hatred had been closely bound and meticulously
repressed. It was still bound, tighter than ever—but it was no longer
repressed.</p>

<p>The deadly engine he tended, silent for a moment, began again to
chatter to those of the enemy; its voice was nearly drowned by their
booming ones, like a spiteful child in a crush of complacent adults....</p>

<p>It turned out that they had been covering a withdrawal of Martian
sappers, and must now escape as best they might. They began to
retreat. The officer running beside him fell. He hesitated. The
officer cursed a new, useless joint that had appeared in his leg.
All the others—including the black-shelled Martians—were ahead. He
glanced around, fearfully, tormentedly, as if he were about to commit
a hideous crime. Then he lifted the officer and staggered on, reeling
like a top at the end of its spin. He was still grinning in a spasmic
way when they reached the security of lesser danger; even when the
officer thanked him with curt sincerity, he couldn't stop grinning.
Nevertheless, they gave him the Order of Planetary Merit for that.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He stared at the watery soup and meat-shreds in his mess-tin. The
cellar was cool, and its seats—though built for creatures with four
legs and two arms—were comfortable. The purple daylight was pleasantly
muted. The noise had gone a little way off, playing cat and mouse. He
was alone.</p>

<p>Of course life had never had any meaning, except for the chillingly
sardonic one perceptible to the demons in the nuclear bombs and the
silver giants in space who pushed the buttons; and he had no stomach
to aspire to that. They'd had ten thousand years to fix things, those
giants, and still all they could tell you was go dig yourself a hole.</p>

<p>In the old days the possibility of relaxation and petty
self-indulgence, against the magnificent sham background of galactic
empire, had permitted him to pretend life had a meaning. Yet at a time
like this, when such an illusion was needful, it ran out on you, jeered
at you along with the lesser lies it had nurtured.</p>

<p>A three-legged creature skipped out of the shadows, halted at a
distance, and subtly intimated it would like food. At first he thought
it must be some Rigelian tripedal, but then he saw it was an Earth-cat
lacking a leg. Its movements were grotesque, but efficient, and not
without a certain gracefulness. How it could have got to this planet,
he found it hard to imagine.</p>

<p>"But you don't worry about that—or even about other cats. Three-legs,"
he thought bitterly. "You hunt alone. You mate with your own kind, when
you can, but then only because it is most agreeable. You don't set up
your own species as a corporate divinity and worship it, and yearn over
the light-centuries of its empire, and eat out your heart because of
it, and humbly spill your blood at its cosmic altar.</p>

<p>"Nor are you hoodwinked when the dogs bark about the greatness of
humanity under a thousand different moons, or when the dumb cattle sigh
from surfeit and gratefully chew their cuds under red, green and purple
suns. You accept us as something sometimes helpful. You walk into our
spaceships as you walked up to our fires. You use us. But when we're
gone, you won't pine on our graves or starve in the pen. You'll manage,
or try to."</p>

<p>The cat mewed. He tossed it a bit of meat, which it caught in its
teeth, shifting about cleverly on the two good hind legs. As he watched
it daintily nibble (though scrawny with famine), he suddenly saw
Kenneth's face, just as he had last seen it on Alpha Centauri Duo. It
seemed very real, projected against the maroon darkness towards the
other end of the cellar. The full tolerant lips lined at the corners,
the veiledly appraising eyes, the space-sallow skin were all exactly as
they had been when they roomed together at the Sign of the Burnt-Out
Jet. But there was a richness and a zest about the face that he had
missed before. He did not try to move toward the illusion, though
he wanted to. He only looked. Then there came the sound of boots on
the floor above, and the cat bounded away, humping its hind quarters
quite like a tripedal, and the vision quickly faded. For a long time
he sat staring at the spot where it had been, feeling a strangely
poignant unhappiness, as if the only worthwhile being in the world had
died. Then he started to eat his food with the vague curiosity of a
two-year-old, sometimes pausing with the spoon half-way to his mouth.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was night, and there was a ground mist through which the
wine-colored moons showed like two sick eyes, and anything might have
been moving in the shadows. He squinted and peered over the rim of
the trench, but it was hard to make out the nature of any object, the
landscape was so torn and distorted. Three men came out of the place
of underground concealment to the left, joking together in hushed,
hollow voices. One whom he knew well (a stocky soldier with big eyes
and smirking lips and reddish stubble on his chin) greeted him with a
friendly jibe about easy jobs. Then they wormed their way up and over,
and started to crawl toward where enemy scouts (six legs or eight?)
were supposed to lie. He lost sight of them very quickly. He held his
weapon ready, watching for the sight of the enemy.</p>

<p>Why did he hate the soldiers of the enemy so little? No more than a
Martian hunting sand-dragons hates sand-dragons. His relationship with
them was limited, almost abstract. How could he hate something so
different from himself in form? He could only marvel that it too had
intelligence. No, the enemy were merely dangerous targets. Once he had
seen one of them escape death, and it had made him feel happy; he had
wanted to wave in a friendly way, even if it could at best have only
wriggled a tentacle in return—</p>

<p>But as for the men who fought side by side with him—he hated them
bitterly, loathed their faces, voices, physical mannerisms. The way
this one chewed and that one spat. Their unchanging curses, cliches,
and jokes. All unendurably magnified, as if his nose were being
rubbed in offal. For they were part of the same miserable, lying,
self-worshipping galactic swarm as himself.</p>

<p>He wondered if he had hated the men at the office on Altair Una in the
same way—</p>

<p>Almost certainly. He recalled the long smoldering irritations
over trifles that had seemed tremendous in the hours between the
violin-moans of the time clock ... but then there had been the safety
valves and shock absorbers that make life tolerable, and also the
illusion of purpose.</p>

<p>But now there was nothing. And everybody knew it.</p>

<p>They had no right to joke about it and continue the pretense.</p>

<p>He was shaking with anger. To kill indiscriminately would at least
demonstrate his feelings. To focus death on the backs of men charging
with inane hysteria. To toss a nuclear fizz-bomb into a dugout where
men sought secret escape in dreams and repeated like prayers their
rationalizations about galactic empires. Dying at his hand, they might
for a moment understand their own vicious hypocrisy.</p>

<p>From out ahead, one of death's little mechanisms spoke concisely,
rapidly. It seemed like a bugle call that only he could hear.</p>

<p>Ruby moonlight slid suddenly across the grotesquely tortured ground. He
raised his weapon and took aim. Its sound pleased him because it was
like a soft groan of agony.</p>

<p>Then he realized he had fired at the abruptly-revealed shadow because
it was that of the stocky soldier who had jibed and crawled away....</p>

<p>The moonlight blacked out as if a curtain had been drawn. His heart
pounded. He ground his teeth and grinned. His feelings were fierce, but
not yet determinate. He became aware of the smells of the ground and of
the chemicals and metals; strong, sharp, interesting smells.</p>

<p>Then he found himself staring at a whitish patch that never got more
than eight inches off the ground. Slowly it approached out of the
darkness, like the inquisitive head of a huge ghost worm. It became
a face with big eyes and smirking lips, fretted with red stubble.
Mechanically he reached out a hand and helped the man down into the
trench.</p>

<p>"Were you the one that winged him? That lousy spider would have gotten
me sure. I didn't see him until he fell on me."</p>

<p>This then was the end. Hereafter he would give in to the mob, run with
the hounds, die purposelessly like a lemming when the time came. Never
again would he aspire to the darker, icy insight that gave life a real
though horrible meaning. He was a ridiculous little communal animal in
a lemming-horde racing across the galaxy, and he would live like one.</p>

<p>He saw the small black object falling swiftly through the mist. The
stocky soldier did not. There was a deafening blast, that slapped the
skin. Looking up he saw the stocky soldier still standing there.
Without a head. As the body stumbled blindly forward, tripped and fell,
he began to laugh in little hissing gusts through his teeth. His lips
were drawn back, so that his jaw muscles twitched and pained him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He felt contemptuous amusement at the blond soldier. The blond soldier
had been to a third-rate nuclear technics school of some sort and
believed it had been a serious mistake to put him in the infantry.
Nevertheless the blond soldier was ambitious and took an unusual
interest in the war.</p>

<p>They stood alone at the crest of a ridge thick with violet and
yellow-spotted vines. In the valleys on either side, their units were
pushing forward. Trails of dust and tracks of mashed vines extended
as far as the eye could see. Various huge engines trompled forward,
carrying men, and other men ran fussily about, freeing engines that
had met with some stop or hindrance, as if the two were inextricably
united in an unimaginable symbiosis. Small machines bearing messengers
went swiftly to and fro like centaurs, a superior type of individual.
Other machines spied watchfully overhead. It was like some vast,
clumsy monster feeling its way; cautiously putting out pseudopods or
horns like a snail's; withdrawing them puzzledly when they touched
anything hurtful or strange; but always gathering itself for a new
effort. It did not flow, but humped and hedged and scuttled. Like an
army of Rigelian roaches. Or the driver ants of Earth that were so
like miniature Martians, with their black-weaponed soldiers, foragers,
scouts, butchers, pack-carriers.</p>

<p>And they were truly neither more nor less than ants. He was no more
than an epidermal cell in a monster that was dueling with another
monster, very careful of its inner organs but careless about its
epidermis. There was something comfortingly abstract and impersonal
about the idea of being united in such a way with many other men, not
because of any shared purpose, but merely because they belonged to the
same monster, a monster so large that it could readily do duty for fate
and necessity. The fellowship of protoplasm.</p>

<p>The blond soldier murmured two or three words, and for a moment he
thought the whole army had spoken to him. Then he understood and made
the necessary adjustment in the instrument they were setting up.</p>

<p>But those two or three words had plunged him with breathtaking
abruptness into the worst sort of inner misery. What was abstract had
become personal, and that was bad. To conceive a monster made of men
was one thing; to feel the insensate, inescapable prod of a neighboring
cell and realize the stifling, close-packed pressure of the whole,
was another. He lifted his hand to his collar. The very air seemed
to convey to his skin the shoving and jostling of distant, invisible
individuals. The nudge of the galactic horde.</p>

<p>They were at the end of the crest now, atop a little hillock, and he
stared ahead to where the unknown objectives lay and where the air
was clearer. He felt as if he were suffocating. His new mood had come
as utterly without warning as most of his moods now came, gushing up
explosively from some wild, alien, ever-expanding dimension within him.</p>

<p>Then, in the broad expanse of fantastically clouded sky ahead of
him, he saw his friends' faces again, orderly and side by side, but
gigantic, like a pantheon of demigods. Just as he had in the cellar
and several times since, only now altogether. The only faces that
meant anything in the cosmos. Black George, with the wide grin, that
looked, but was not, stupid. Hollow-cheeked Loren, peering up with
shy canniness, about to argue. Dark Helen, with her proud, subtle
lips. Sallow Kenneth again, with his veiledly appraising eyes. And
Albert, and Maurice, and Kate. And others whose features were blurred,
heartbreakingly suggesting friends forgot. All transfigured and glowing
with warmth and light. As meaningful as symbols, yet holding each
within itself the quintescence of individuality.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He stood stock-still, beginning to tremble, feeling great guilt.
How had he neglected and deserted them? His friends, the only ones
deserving his loyalty, the only island for him in the cosmos-choking
sea of humanity, the only ones with worth and meaning; compared to
which race and creed and humanity were without significance. It
was as self-evident and undeniable as a premise in mathematics.
Heretofore he had seen only the masks of reality, the reflections, the
countershadows. Now, at a bound, he stood beside the gods in darkness
who pulled the wires.</p>

<p>The vision faded, became part of his mind. He turned, and it was
as if he saw the blond soldier for the first time. How had he ever
believed that he and the other soldier might have anything in common?
The gulf between them was far greater than if they had belonged to
different species. Why had he ever given two thoughts to such a silly,
squinty-eyed, bustling little organism? He never would again. It was
all very clear.</p>

<p>"We'll get them this time," the other soldier said with conviction.
"We've got the stuff now. We'll show the bugs. Come on!"</p>

<p>It was wonderful, hysterical, insufferable. Yesterday, spiders. Today,
bugs. Tomorrow—worms? The other soldier really believed it was
important and noble. He could still pretend there was that kind of
meaning and purpose to that sort of slaughter.</p>

<p>"Come on. Get the beta cycling," said the other soldier impatiently,
nudging him.</p>

<p>It was all very clear. And he would never lose that clarity. By one
action he would cut himself off from the galactic pack and cleave
forever to the faces in the sky.</p>

<p>"Come on," ordered the other soldier, jerking at him.</p>

<p>He unsheathed his weapon, touched a button. Silently a dull black spot,
not a hole, appeared in the back of the blond soldier's head. He hid
the body, walked down the other side of the hill, and attached himself
to another unit. By morning they were retreating again, the monster
badly hurt and automatically resisting disillusion.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He was an officer now.</p>

<p>"I don't like him," said a soldier. "Of course, they all try to scare
you, whether they know it or not. Part of the business. But with him
it's different. I know he doesn't talk tough, or threaten or act grim.
I know he's pleasant enough when he takes time to notice you. Even
sympathetic. But there's something there I can't put my finger on.
Something cold-blooded. Like he wasn't even alive—or as if <i>we</i>
weren't. Even when he acts especially decent or thoughtful toward me, I
know he doesn't give a damn. It's his eyes. I can read meaning in the
eyes of a Fomalhautian blind-worm. But I can't read anything in his."</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The soaring city seemed alien, though it had once been home. He liked
it the better for that. Civilian clothes felt strange against his skin.</p>

<p>He whisked briskly along the sidewalk, taking the turns aimlessly when
it split at the pedestrian cloverleafs. He looked at the passing faces
with frank inquisitiveness, as if he were at a zoo. He just wanted to
enjoy the feeling of anonymity for a little while. He knew what he was
going to do afterwards. There were his friends—and there were the
animals. The fortunes of his friends were to be advanced.</p>

<p>Beside the next cloverleaf was a speaker, and a little crowd. There had
been a good deal of that sort of stuff since the truce. Curiously he
listened, recognized the weakness of the words. They were sloshed with
ideas, tainted with unprofitable, poorly-selected hatreds. The call to
action was tinged by an undercurrent of bitterness that argued inaction
would be better. They were civilized words, and therefore useless to
one who wanted to become an animal trainer on a galactic scale. What
a zoo he'd have some day—and every single beast in it advertised as
intelligent!</p>

<p>Other words and phrases began to ooze up into his mind: "Thinkers!
Listen to me ... cheated of what you deserve ... misled by misled
men ... the galactic run-around ... this engineered truce ... the
creatures who used the war to consolidate their power ... the Cosmic
Declaration of Servitude ... life—to lose ... liberty—to obey ... and
as for the pursuit of happiness—happiness is a light-millenium ahead
of all of us ... our universal rights.... Free Martia! Terra for All!
Revenge...."</p>

<p>These unspoken words, he felt, were the harbingers of leadership.
Alexander had done it. Hitler had done it. Smith had done it. Hrivlath
had done it. The Neuron had done it. The Great Centaur had done it. All
murderers—for only murderers won. He saw the brilliant light-years of
his future ahead, endlessly. He saw no details, but it was all of the
same imperial color. Never again would he hesitate. Each moment would
decide something. Each of his future actions would drop like a grain of
sand from an ancient hour glass, inevitable as time.</p>

<p>Profound excitement seized him. The scene around him grew and grew
until he seemed at the center of a vast, ominous, spellbound crowd
that filled the galaxy. The faces of his friends were close, eager and
confident. And from a great distance, as if from beyond the stars, he
seemed to see his own face staring back at him, pale, skull-eyed, and
insatiably hungry.</p>

of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
